# MyntraHackerRamp Round 2 Submission

## Theme : Socialize 
## About the Project

A website that links E-Commerce and Social media together that allows users to add posts and link it with products on the website 

We used MongoDB schemas to link together the product and post schemas
This will enable the user to view the product of their liking directly from the post.
We have implemented a system wherein the users can follow other users to view their private posts.
The users can like the posts, leave a comment and share.
We used socket.io to send real time messages between users. 
The authorization and authentication system was implemented with the help of passport.js
There is also a feature to sort all the products by price and delivery time.
